Tools to Deal with Fuzzy Numbers in R


*FuzzyNumbers* is an open source (LGPL 3) package for R. It provides S4 classes and methods to deal 
with fuzzy numbers and allows for computations of arithmetic operations on fuzzy numbers, 
approximation by trapezoidal and piecewise linear fuzzy numbers, etc. 
The package may be used by the practitioners as well as by the researchers in fuzzy numbers 
theory (e.g. for preparing figures, generating numerical examples, or testing new algorithms).

Fuzzy set theory lets us effectively and quite intuitively represent imprecise 
or vague information. Fuzzy numbers, which form a particular subclass of fuzzy sets 
of the real line, play a significant role in many important both theoretical and 
practical considerations. This is because we often describe our knowledge 
about objects through numbers, e.g. "I'm about 180 cm tall" or 
"The rocket was launched between 2 and 3 p.m.".

The package aims to provide the following functionality:

*    Representation of arbitrary fuzzy numbers (including FNs with discontinuous side functions and/or alpha-cuts), as well as their particular types, e.g. trapezoidal and piecewise linear fuzzy numbers,
*    Random fuzzy numbers generation [TO DO],
*    Defuzzification and Approximation of Fuzzy Numbers by Triangular and Piecewise Linear fuzzy numbers,
*    Visualization of fuzzy numbers,
*    Operations on fuzzy numbers [TO DO],
*    Aggregation of fuzzy numbers [TO DO],
*    Ranking of fuzzy numbers [TO DO].
