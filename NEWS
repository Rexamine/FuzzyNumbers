                   ** FuzzyNumbers Package NEWS **

***************************************************************************

0.3-0 /under development/

* piecewiseLinearApproximation() - general case (any knot.n)
  for method="NearestEuclidean" now available.

* New binary arithmetic operators, especially
   for PiecewiseLinearFuzzyNumbers: +, -, *, /

* New function: fapply() - applies a function on a PLFN
  using the extension principle

* New methods: as.character(); also used by show().
  This function also allows to generate LaTeX code defining the FN
  (toLaTeX arg thanks to Jan Caha).

* as.PiecewiseLinearFuzzyNumber() is now an S4 method,
  and can be called on objects of type numeric, as well as on
  various FNs

* ...

* piecewiseLinearApproximation() and as.PiecewiseLinearFuzzyNumber()
  argument `knot.alpha` now defaults to equally distributed knots
  (via given `knot.n`)

* PiecewiseLinearFuzzyNumber() now accepts missing `a1`, `a2`, `a3`, `a4`,
  and `knot.left`, `knot.right` of length `knot.n`+2. Moreover, if `knot.n`
  is not given, then it is guessed from length(knot.left).
  If `knot.alpha` is missing, then the knots will be equally distributed
  on the interval [0,1].

* Added a call to  setGeneric("plot", function(x, y, ...) ...
  to avoid a warning on install

* The FuzzyNumbers Tutorial has been properly included
  as the package's vignette

* Man pages update & cleanup

***************************************************************************

0.2-1 /2012-12-27/

* approx.invert(): a new function to find the numerical
  inverse of a given side/alpha-cut generating function
  (by default via Hermite monotonic spline interpolation)

* convert.side(), convert.alpha():
  new functions to convert sides and alpha cuts
  to side generating funs and alpha cut generators

* FuzzyNumber class validity check for lower, upper, left, right:
   * checks whether each function is properly vectorized
      and gives numeric results
   * does not check for the number of formal arguments,
      but just uses the first from the list

* suggests `testthat`

* each object has been documented

* first CRAN release
