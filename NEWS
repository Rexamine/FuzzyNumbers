FuzzyNumbers Package NEWS

***************************************************************************

0.03 /under development/

* Added a call to  setGeneric("plot", function(x, y, ...) ...
  to avoid a warning on install

* New methods: as.character(); also used by show().
  This function also allows to generate LaTeX code defining the FN
  (toLaTeX arg thanks to Jan Caha).

* New binary arithmetic operators for PiecewiseLinearFuzzyNumbers: +,-,*,/

* piecewiseLinearApproximation() argument knot.alpha
  now defaults to equally distributed knots (via given knot.n)

* PiecewiseLinearFuzzyNumber() now accepts missing a1, a2, a3, a4,
  and knot.left, knot.right of length knot.n+2. Moreover, if \code{knot.n}
  is not given, then it is guessed from \code{length(knot.left)}.
  If \code{knot.alpha} is missing, then the knots will be equally distributed
  on the interval [0,1].

0.02 /2012-12-27/

* approx.invert(): a new function to find the numerical
  inverse of a given side/alpha-cut generating function
  (by default via Hermite monotonic spline interpolation)

* convert.side(), convert.alpha():
  new functions to convert sides and alpha cuts
  to side generating funs and alpha cut generators

* FuzzyNumber class validity check for lower, upper, left, right:
   * checks whether each function is properly vectorized
      and gives numeric results
   * does not check for the number of formal arguments,
      but just uses the first from the list

* suggests `testthat`

* each object has been documented
